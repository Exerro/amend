# Amend

A preprocessor and build system for ComputerCraft.

### Goals

Amend aims to provide a fully functional environment to build and distribute programs.

It is designed to handle large and multi-file projects natively, with support for advanced features like macros, error mapping, conditional compilation, and minification.

It has extensibility built into its core, allowing required extensions to be added.
